      <li>Oregon</li>
      <p>Tualitin Oregon is my place of birth, and the state has been my consistent home for the last 20 or so years of my life. From beautiful mountain tops to quaint breweries, I am proud to be a locale of the Great NorthWest.</p>
      <li>Florida</li>
      <p>South Florida is my entire family line, home of the most exciting and tradion-friendly Cubans. Here, I hold a place in my heart for deep family roots and a background that I have always identified more than that of common American culture.</p>
      <li>Washington D.C.</li>
      <p>D.C has shown me many things, but most importantly, what it means for all of us, regardless of political bias, to be an American. Between the stellar and incredibly moving museums and historically stiffling memorials, I have since recognized the burden and power of choice that we all possess. </p>
